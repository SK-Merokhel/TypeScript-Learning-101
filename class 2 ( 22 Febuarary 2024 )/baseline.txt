Step 1: Environment Setup

Node.js Installation:
Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/. Node.js is required to run JavaScript code and comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which we'll use for managing dependencies.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Installation:
Download and install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/. We'll use VS Code for writing our TypeScript code.

Directory Setup:
Create a directory on your desktop named "typescript_learning". Within this directory, create another directory named "class 2 ( 22 Febuarary 2024 )".

Step 2: Installing TypeScript Compiler

Install TypeScript Compiler:
To compile TypeScript code, we need to install the TypeScript compiler globally using npm.
Run the command npm install --global typescript in the terminal. This will install TypeScript globally on your system.

Step 3: Initial Coding

Open in VS Code:
Open the "class 2 ( 22 Febuarary 2024 )" directory in VS Code using the terminal.

Create a TypeScript File:
Within this directory, create a new file named "helloworld.ts". This file will contain our initial TypeScript code.

Step 4: Transpilation

Transpile TypeScript to JavaScript:
We'll use the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to convert our TypeScript code into JavaScript.
Run the command tsc helloworld.ts in the terminal. This will generate a JavaScript file named "helloworld.js" in the same directory.

Step 5: Running the Code

Using Node.js:
Now, we'll use Node.js to interpret and execute our JavaScript code.
Navigate to the directory containing the generated JavaScript file.
Run the command node helloworld.js in the terminal.
You should see the output of our TypeScript code, "Hello, World!", displayed in the terminal.
